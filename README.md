ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸŒ¸

I recently completed a project where I built a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to classify the Iris dataset. This dataset is a classic in the world of machine learning, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one of three classes (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica).

Project Highlights:
Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset
Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Model Architecture:
Input Layer: 4 features
Hidden Layers: 2 layers with 8 neurons each, using ReLU activation
Output Layer: 3 neurons with Softmax activation for multi-class classification
Preprocessing:
Standardized the features using Scikit-learn's StandardScaler
One-hot encoded the target variable
Model Training:
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Epochs: 50
Batch Size: 4
Validation Split: 20%
Results:
Achieved a test accuracy of 95.0%
This project not only reinforced my understanding of neural networks but also demonstrated the importance of data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning. It's a great example of how even a basic deep learning project can achieve impressive results with the right approach.
